<p> Below are the descriptions of each tab in the PheValuator Module, which will appear after clicking the "Generate Results" button below: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Phenotypes – Phenotypes, with SQL and JSON code, examined using PheValuator. </li>
  <li> Model Input Parameters – R function parameters used in PheValuator to develop the diagnostic predictive models. </li>
  <li> Model Performance – performance characteristics of the diagnostic predictive models used in PheValuator, e.g., area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC). </li>
  <li> Model Covariates – included covariates and beta coefficients of the diagnostic predictive model. </li>
  <li> Evaluation Cohort Parameters - R function parameters used in PheValuator to develop the evaluation cohort used to determine phenotype algorithm performance. </li>
  <li> Test Subjects and Covariates – examples of test subjects evaluated to be false positive or negative and true positive or negative and their associated covariates included in the diagnostic predictive model. </li>
  <li> Phenotype Performance Characteristics – estimates for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value for phenotype algorithms tested by PheValuator. </li>
</ul>
